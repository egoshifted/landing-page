This is my first independent HTML & CSS project which forms part of my journey through The Odin Project.

So far it's been a week since I started learning code. I have covered how to use the terminal, Git, GitHub, basics of HTML & CSS as well as the flexbox framework.

What I have been enjoying the most is when something which doesn't quite make sense finally clicks in my head, it's a very rewarding feeling indeed.
